# SaturnV For GTA V Legacy Story Mode

SaturnV is a 100% Free offline mod menu/trainer for gta 5 legacy designed to enhance your gameplay. With over 300 features and more being added daily, there is a vast amount off possibilities you can have when using SaturnV Such as Lua Scripting.

## Lua for SaturnV
You can view a full lua guide at https://github.com/nbz1559/SaturnV-Lua-Guide
I have decided to intergrate lua into SaturnV, as a further customization option, meaning you can create your OWN lua scripts, 100% made by you, meaning you can make pretty much whatever you want

## About
SaturnV was created with the idea of being one of the best trainers for legacy, it first started development on the 29th of August, 2025 and has since grown with around 10 - 20 new features added per update.
