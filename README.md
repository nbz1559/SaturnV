# SaturnV For GTA V Story Mode

SaturnV is a free offline mod menu/trainer for GTA 5 Legacy and GTA 5 Enhanced. It has many features like a fully custom made Lua Intergration, a portable Los Santos Customs, the ability to save states in your menu so you can load them right back the next time you play, an Info Overlay which can show you many in-game statistics, the power to load parts of the map normally not visible or obtainable in, and that is just a glimpse of the full menu.

## Lua for SaturnV
I have decidied to intergrate Lua with SaturnV as a further customization option. You can make your own custom scripts, which can be modified at will, and allows you to do pretty much anything, you can even make features not native to SaturnV and share them in the discord for other people to use!

## About
I started making SaturnV on the 29th of August, 2025 as a little side project that wasnt meant to be anything serious. Then I realized this had the potential to be one of the best Story Mode menus, all for free! It has grown a lot since its first release, with updates even coming out within hours of each other, expanding to be better and better through each one.

## Updates
An update log for Lua Scripting can be viewed at https://github.com/nbz1559/SaturnV-Lua-Guide/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md, and one for SaturnV in ```UPDATES.md```
