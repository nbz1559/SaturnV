SaturnV is a story mode mod menu/trainer for GTA 5. It has many features like a fully custom made Lua Intergration, a portable Los Santos Customs, the ability to save states in your menu so you can load them right back the next time you play, an Info Overlay which can show you many in-game statistics, the power to load parts of the map normally not visible or obtainable in, and that is just a glimpse of the full menu.

I have decidied to intergrate Lua with SaturnV as a further customization option. You can make your own custom scripts, which can be modified at will, and allows you to do pretty much anything, you can even make features not native to SaturnV and share them in the discord for other people to use!
